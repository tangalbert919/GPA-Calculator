# GPA Calculator
-------------------
This is just what it says in the name: A GPA Calculator. I don't know why I bothered to add a license to this.

This is for people who want to find out what their GPA is, and those people are typically students in high school or college. Knowing your GPA is useful to finding the colleges with students that have a similar GPA as you (but that's if you're still in high school, or transferring to another college).

### Features
-------------------
* Get your weighted and unweighted GPA based on percentage (0-100 scale) and credits.
* Minimalist GUI (and I mean MINIMALIST). Use the batch file (Windows) or shell scripts (everyone else) to run it.
* Reads the text file you specified to calculate your GPA (refer to the HOWTO.txt file for instructions).
* Compares your current GPA to last results (after doing the first run).
* Shell scripts and batch files are provided to compile the program from source code.

### Planned
-------------------
* Create a graph that shows how your GPA is changing.
* Construct a GUI for those who don't want to run the command-line version.
