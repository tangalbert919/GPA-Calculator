# GPA Calculator
-------------------
This is just what it says in the name: A GPA Calculator. I don't know why I bothered to add a license to this.

This is for people who want to find out what their GPA is, and those people are typically students in high school or college. Knowing your GPA is useful to finding the colleges with students that have a similar GPA as you (but that's if you're still in high school, or transferring to another college).

### Features
-------------------
* Get your GPA based on percentage (0-100 scale), both weighted and unweighted.
* Minimalist GUI (and I mean MINIMALIST). Use the batch file (Windows) or shell scripts (everyone else) to run it.
* Reads the text file you specified to calculate your GPA (refer to the HOWTO.txt file for instructions).
* Compares your current GPA to last results (after doing the first run).
* Shell scripts and batch files are provided to compile the program from source code.
* As of version 1.01, Java 7 is the minimum. Java 6 support was removed due to how old and unsecured it is.

### Planned
-------------------
* Get your GPA based on credits (both weighted and unweighted).
* Create a graph that shows how your GPA is changing.
