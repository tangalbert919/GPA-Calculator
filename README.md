# GPA Calculator
-------------------
This is just what it says in the name: A GPA Calculator. I don't know why I bothered to add a license to this.

This is for people who want to find out what their GPA is, and those people are typically students in high school or college. Knowing your GPA is useful to finding the colleges with students that have a similar GPA as you (but that's if you're still in high school, or transferring to another college).

### Features
-------------------
* Get your GPA based on percentage (0-100 scale), both weighted and unweighted.
* Minimalist GUI so only what you need is there.

### Planned
-------------------
* Get your GPA based on credits and score (both weighted and unweighted).
