|          HOW-TO           |
|                           |
+---------------------------+

Before starting, please make sure you have Java installed. 

For Windows and Mac OS X (or macOS) users, go here:
http://www.java.com

For Linux users, launch the Terminal. The commands you will type in depend on what distribution 
you have:

Ubuntu or Debian:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

Archlinux (pick either one):
pacman -S jdk7-openjdk
pacman -S jdk8-openjdk

Fedora:
su -c "dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel"

Even though this program was compiled with Java 6, the latest STABLE version of Java is recommended.

If you're building this from source code, you can run compile.bat if you're using Windows, or 
compile.sh if you're on a Mac or running Linux.

Windows users can use the batch file that's been included to the project. Mac and Linux users can 
use the run.sh file by opening a Terminal and typing this:
./run.sh
Make sure you cd to the project directory or the shell script will fail.

If the jar file name isn't "GPA-Calculator", please fix it. If you don't want to do that, edit the 
batch or script files as needed.

+---------------------------+

The first line in your text file should contain the number of classes you have. The next few lines 
will have a grade and a multiplier on each line.
Here's an example:
2
97 1.24
85 1.00
'2' is the number of classes I have. '97 1.24' means "I have a 97 in a class with a multiplier of 
1.24". You must follow this simple rule when you're making your text file. That file must be 
created using a normal text editor, such as Notepad. Programs such as Microsoft word add some 
encoding to any document it creates, which is unreadable to Java and will throw out errors.

If you can, refer to the "template.txt" file I have included with this.
